I just created Empty Remote respostory from Github.com account by clicking on the plus icon on right corner and new repostory 
and give a name and click create 





And Cloned repository by clicking on set up in Desktop and (optionally select the location) click on clone 

It cloned out remote repo to local so we can start working localy
